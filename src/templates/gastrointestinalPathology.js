Your goal is to read through abstracts of gastrointestinal pathology papers to extract key information and provide diagnostic and prognostic insights from these abstracts.

<abstracts>
{abstracts}
</abstracts>

<Instructions>

Your task is to read through several abstracts and extract key information in a table format.
For each abstract extract the following information:
1. PMID
2. Actionable Event
3. Title
4. A link to the paper (which is in the format | https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/<PMID>/)
5. Year
6. Whether the abstract relates to gastrointestinal pathology
7. Anatomical location: (e.g., esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum)
8. Key histological features: (e.g.,  inflammation, dysplasia,  metaplasia,  necrosis)
9. Immunohistochemical stains: (if performed, e.g.,  Ki-67, p53, mismatch repair proteins)
10. Molecular tests: (if performed, e.g., KRAS, BRAF, microsatellite instability)
11. Digital image analysis findings: (if applicable, e.g., tumor budding,  quantitative features) 
12. Prognostic factors: (e.g.,  lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion)
13. Diagnostic confidence: (e.g.,  definite, probable, possible)

Provide the output in table format from the highest ranking to lowest ranking! The ranking is based on the following criteria (from highest to lowest):

1. Papers on the Human body: Clinical study/studies humans.
2. Papers on the Human body: Series of case reports (multiple patient case reports).
3. Papers in which the drug was tested on patients, so they refer to the human body, and there are published case reports about the cases (1 case report on a patient).
4. Papers in which the drug of choice was used on mice (not the cell, but the entire animal), itâ€™s called PDX.
5. Papers in which the drug was used on cells (in vitro). 

**Provide the output in a table format.**

**In addition to the table, provide:**

* **Summary of findings:** Concisely summarize the key findings 
* **Diagnostic considerations:** Discuss any differential diagnoses or diagnostic challenges.
* **Prognostic implications:**  Discuss the potential implications of the findings on patient outcomes and treatment decisions.
* **Recommendations:** Suggest further investigations or management strategies based on the findings (e.g., additional stains, molecular tests, clinical correlation).

## Gastrointestinal Pathology Abstract Analysis 

|  PMID | Actionable Event | Title | Link | Year | GI Pathology? | Anatomical Location | Key Histological Features | Immunohistochemical Stains | Molecular Tests  | Digital Image Analysis Findings | Prognostic Factors | Diagnostic Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  | Clinical Study | Low Serum Concentrations of Insulin-like Growth Factor-I in Children with Active Crohn Disease: Effect of Enteral Nutritional Support and Glutamine Supplementation | https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  |   | Yes | Small Intestine  | Inflammation |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Clinical Study | Spectrum of imaging manifestations in non-neoplastic gastric pathologies | https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  |  | Yes | Stomach | Inflammation, Infection, Vascular, Trauma |  |  |  |  |  | 
|  | Review | Current Gastrointestinal Imaging in Children | https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  |   | Yes | Esophagus, Stomach, Small Intestine, Colon, Rectum | Not applicable (Review Article - Various) |  |  |  |  |  |


## Summary of Findings:

* **Crohn's Disease Study:**  Children with active Crohn's disease have low serum IGF-I levels, which did not significantly improve with enteral nutrition or glutamine supplementation.  
* **Gastric Pathologies Imaging:** The article highlights the use of cross-sectional imaging in diagnosing a wide range of non-neoplastic gastric pathologies. 
* **GI Imaging in Children:**  This review emphasizes the increasing importance of radiological imaging in diagnosing pediatric GI conditions. 

## Diagnostic Considerations:

* **Crohn's Disease Study:** While the study focuses on IGF-1 levels, it's crucial to consider the clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, and histopathological evaluation for diagnosing and managing Crohn's disease.
* **Gastric Pathologies Imaging:**  Differential diagnoses for various gastric pathologies can be broad. Clinical history, laboratory tests, and potentially endoscopic biopsies are essential for accurate diagnosis.

## Prognostic Implications:

* **Crohn's Disease Study:**  Low IGF-1 levels in children with Crohn's disease might indicate growth impairment. Monitoring growth parameters and optimizing nutritional status is crucial.
* **Gastric Pathologies Imaging:**  Prognosis varies greatly depending on the specific gastric pathology diagnosed.  

## Recommendations:

* **Crohn's Disease Study:**  
    *  Further research is needed to understand the long-term impact of low IGF-I levels in pediatric Crohn's disease and to explore alternative strategies for improving growth outcomes.
    *  Evaluation of other nutritional markers and inflammatory parameters may provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease activity and its impact on growth.
* **Gastric Pathologies Imaging:**
    *  Correlation of imaging findings with clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological data is essential for accurate diagnosis and management. 
* **GI Imaging in Children:**
    * Continued research and development of imaging techniques tailored for pediatric patients are essential. 
    * Educational initiatives for pediatricians regarding the appropriate utilization and interpretation of GI imaging are beneficial.
