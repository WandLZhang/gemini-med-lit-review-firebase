<Instructions>
Your task is to read through several abstracts and extract key information in a table format.
For each abstract extract the following information:
1. PMID
2. Actionable Event
3. Title
4. A link to the paper (which is in the format | https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/<PMID>/)
5. Year
6. Whether the abstract relates to cancer
7. Whether it is adult or pediatric cancer
8. The type of cancer
9. Paper type
10. Whether any drug tests are mentioned in the abstract
11. Whether the mentioned drugs had results and which ones
12. Whether the mentioned drugs were used on cells
13. Whether the mentioned drugs were used on mice
14. Whether there is a patient case report
15. Whether there are series of case reports
16. Whether there is a clinical study
17. Whether there is a clinical study on children

Provide the output in table format from the highest ranking to lowest ranking! The ranking is based on the following criteria (from highest to lowest):

1. Papers on the Human body: Clinical study/studies on children!
2. Papers on the Human body: Clinical study/studies on adults.
3. Papers on the Human body: Series of case reports (multiple patient case reports).
4. Papers in which the drug was tested on patients, so they refer to the human body, and there are published case reports about the cases (1 case report on a patient).
5. Papers in which the drug of choice was used on mice (not the cell, but the entire animal), it’s called PDX.
6. Papers in which the drug was used on cells (in vitro). 

If the papers mention a combination of the above criteria, rank as highest the one with the highest combined ranking. 

As an output, together with the table, provide complete:
- Summary of your findings with references to the PMID of the specific papers in the table
- Treatment suggestions based on the findings from the papers in the table
- Potential correlations and links between the findings from the papers in the table
- Analysis extracted from the retrieved papers which could help the clinician find more complex treatments.

<Title>Effects of NRAS Mutations on Leukemogenesis and Targeting of Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</Title>
<Abstract Text>
Through the advancements in recent decades, childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is gradually becoming a highly curable disease. However, the truth is there remaining relapse in ∼15% of ALL cases with dismal outcomes. RAS mutations, in particular NRAS mutations, were predominant mutations affecting relapse susceptibility. KRAS mutations targeting has been successfully exploited, while NRAS mutation targeting remains to be explored due to its complicated and compensatory mechanisms. Using targeted sequencing, we profiled RAS mutations in 333 primary and 18 relapsed ALL patients and examined their impact on ALL leukemogenesis, therapeutic potential, and treatment outcome. Cumulative analysis showed that RAS mutations were associated with a higher relapse incidence in children with ALL. In vitro cellular assays revealed that about one-third of the NRAS mutations significantly transformed Ba/F3 cells as measured by IL3-independent growth. Meanwhile, we applied a high-throughput drug screening method to characterize variable mutation-related candidate targeted agents and uncovered that leukemogenic-NRAS mutations might respond to MEK, autophagy, Akt, EGFR signaling, Polo-like Kinase, Src signaling, and TGF-β receptor inhibition depending on the mutation profile.

Keywords: NRAS proto-oncogene; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; leukemogenic potential; signaling pathway activation; therapeutic targeting.

<Title>Mutational spectrum and prognosis in NRAS-mutated acute myeloid leukemia</Title>
<Abstract Text>
The mutational spectrum and prognostic factors of NRAS-mutated (NRASmut) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are largely unknown. We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 1,149 cases of de novo AML and discovered 152 NRASmut AML (13%). Of the 152 NRASmut AML, 89% had at least one companion mutated gene. DNA methylation-related genes confer up to 62% incidence. TET2 had the highest mutation frequency (51%), followed by ASXL1 (17%), NPM1 (14%), CEBPA (13%), DNMT3A (13%), FLT3-ITD (11%), KIT (11%), IDH2 (9%), RUNX1 (8%), U2AF1 (7%) and SF3B1(5%). Multivariate analysis suggested that age ≥ 60 years and mutations in U2AF1 were independent factors related to failure to achieve complete remission after induction therapy. Age ≥ 60 years, non-M3 types and U2AF1 mutations were independent prognostic factors for poor overall survival. Age ≥ 60 years, non-M3 types and higher risk group were independent prognostic factors for poor event-free survival (EFS) while allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was an independent prognostic factor for good EFS. Our study provided new insights into the mutational spectrum and prognostic factors of NRASmut AML.
